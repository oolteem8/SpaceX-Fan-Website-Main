                    The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to make space travel available for almost anyone. We also wish to make space travel
                    something people look to with excitement again, the way everyone was captivated by the first mission to the moon -
                    Apollo 11.

                    <p class="main-text">
                        Our largest goal is to make humanity an interplanetary species. The first step in doing this is by colonizing Mars,
                        the nearest habitable planet to Earth. Once we can survive - and possibly thrive - on Mars, we can work on 
                        inhabiting other planets further away from
                        Earth.
                        <br><br>
                        Why colonize Mars in the first place? Pure curiosity, the potential for humans to provide more in-depth 
                        observational research than unmanned rovers, economic interest in its resources, and the possibility that if our
                        home is destroyed, humanity as a race will carry on.

                    <h2>Reusable Rockets</h2>
                    <p class="main-text">
                        A rapidly reusable spacelaunch vehicle could reduce the cost of spacetravel a hundredfold. Each spacecraft
                        costs as much as a commercial airliner, which can be flown multiple times a day for many years.
                        Rockets, however, traditionally can only be used once; they are usually designed to burn up on reentry.

                        Enter SpaceX rockets. They can not only wihtstand the heat and speed of reentry, but can also successfully
                        land on earth and fly again. Our rockets are the only orbital class rockets capable of reflight.
